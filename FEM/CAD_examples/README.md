MATLAB pdetool examples that use CAD files (.stl).  Some of these CAD files are natively within MATLAB's directories.  Note that the "pdetool" is the "Partial differential equations toolbox" and does not ship natively with MATLAB.  It is additional and needs to be purchased and installed.  If your institution has access to an academic license of MATLAB,  it is likely that they have access to the pdetool for academic purposes.
