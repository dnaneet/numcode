Code used in an "intro to thermodynamics" course.

 - MATLAB
 - python (future)
 - Mathematica (future)

The Thermodynamics page holds computer code written in MATLAB, python and Mathematica that may be used for an introductory course in thermodynamics. At the time of initialization of this wiki page (14, November 2018), only MATLAB programs have been uploaded to this page.

The code on the thermodynamics page uses the XSteam MATLAB function that is based on the IAPWS IF97 formulation for water and steam properties. The code has been validated against thermodynamics data tables.

The textbook from which problems have been solved are abbreviated in the file name of the MATLAB code and also have been included as an abbreviation in the comments within a script. Eg: CB9: Cengel and Boles, 9th edition.

Use this code at your discretion.
